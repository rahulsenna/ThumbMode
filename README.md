# Virtual Thumb Cluster on MacBook Trackpad

This project simulates a virtual thumb cluster, similar to those found on custom ergonomic keyboards, using the MacBook trackpad. It's inspired by and builds upon the foundation of [OpenMultitouchSupport](https://github.com/Kyome22/OpenMultitouchSupport).

**What it does:**

This software allows you to define specific zones on your MacBook trackpad that, when touched, trigger custom key presses or actions, mimicking the functionality of dedicated thumb keys on an ergonomic keyboard. This can significantly enhance your workflow by providing easily accessible shortcuts without having to move your hands far from the home row.

**Key Features:**

* **Customizable Zones:** Define the size and position of your virtual thumb keys on the trackpad.
* **Key Mapping:** Assign specific keyboard keys or even complex shortcuts to each defined zone.
* **Ergonomic Benefits:** Reduce finger travel and strain by placing frequently used keys under your thumbs.
* **Inspired by OpenMultitouchSupport:** Leverages the robust multitouch input capabilities provided by the original project.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * A MacBook with a functioning trackpad.
    * macOS (compatibility with specific versions may vary; testing is welcome).
    * [OpenMultitouchSupport](https://github.com/Kyome22/OpenMultitouchSupport) needs to be installed and potentially running (refer to its installation instructions).

2.  **Installation:**
    * *(Detailed installation instructions specific to this project will be provided here as development progresses.)* This may involve cloning this repository and potentially building an application or configuring scripts.

3.  **Configuration:**
    * *(Instructions on how to define zones and map keys will be provided here.)* This will likely involve editing a configuration file or using a graphical interface (if developed).

**Usage:**

Once configured and running, touching the defined zones on your trackpad will trigger the assigned key presses or actions.

**Contributing:**

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvement, bug fixes, or new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
